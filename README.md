# What is P2P Trading?
P2P trading, also known as peer-to-peer or person-to-person trading, is one of the first ways users could buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrency. P2P trading also is in line with Bitcoin’s founder Satoshi Nakomoto’s idea of Bitcoin being a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. Originally, it allowed you to trade directly with another party without using centralized exchanges. The exchange could occur in person or online communities where buyers and sellers meet. P2P soon became a popular mode of crypto trading due to a lack of trading options during crypto’s early days.
