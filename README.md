# Arwen-p2p-finance
Arwen was created to enable P2P crypto exchange transactions with local currencies. The service is a peer-to-peer marketplace that allows you to directly trade cryptocurrencies with other Arwen users using your preferred local currency, price, and payment method. 



# What is P2P Trading?
P2P trading, also known as peer-to-peer or person-to-person trading, is one of the first ways users could buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrency. P2P trading also is in line with Bitcoin’s founder Satoshi Nakomoto’s idea of Bitcoin being a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. Originally, it allowed you to trade directly with another party without using centralized exchanges. The exchange could occur in person or online communities where buyers and sellers meet. P2P soon became a popular mode of crypto trading due to a lack of trading options during crypto’s early days. P2P methods for buying cryptocurrency with fiat currency typically involve using a peer-to-peer exchange platform. These platforms allow users to list their cryptocurrency holdings and set a price, as well as find buyers willing to pay the listed price in fiat currency. Once a match is found, the two parties can complete the transaction using the platform as a escrow service.



# Current P2P exchange platforms and their risks
Cryptocurrencies by design are meant to function without a middleman but this is not the case in real life. There are a number of reasons why cryptocurrencies are not entirely decentralized in practice. First, most cryptocurrencies are still traded on centralized exchanges, which means that there is a central point of control. Second, 
to buy crypto with fiat we are heavily depending upon centralized exchanges. There are several problems with centralized methods of buying crypto currencies.

1) The first and most obvious problem is that these methods are subject to the whims of the central authority. If the central authority decides to change the rules or shut down the system, there is nothing that users can do to stop them. This makes centralized methods of buying crypto currencies very risky and unpredictable.

2) Another problem with centralized methods of buying crypto currencies is that they are often very slow and cumbersome. This is because all transactions must go through the central authority, which can take time to process. This can make it difficult to buy or sell crypto currencies in a timely manner.

3) Finally, centralized methods of buying crypto currencies can be very expensive. This is because the central authority typically charges high fees for their services. This can make it difficult to profit from buying or selling crypto currencies.



# Arwen P2P and why we need it?
Arwen is an experimental project to reduce this dependency on centralized exchanges for buying crypto with fiat currency. This can make Defi stand independent by preventing any central point of failure or control. When using P2P methods to buy cryptocurrency on a centralized exchange, you are essentially giving up control of your funds to the exchange, Because from the side of the seller the crypto is locked in an escrow wallet which is owned by the exchange and from the side of buyer the crypto needed to be transferred from the escrow wallet to the user wallet which is again controlled by the exchange itself. This means that you are at the mercy of the exchange when it comes to things like withdrawal limits, KYC/AML requirements, and other terms and conditions. But Arwen is a decentralized application smart contract that facilitates the P2P marketplace and every crypto transaction that takes place is from wallet to wallet which is controlled by the users themselves.
